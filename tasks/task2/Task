Task 2

* Start learning MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/introduction/
* Spin up a FREE FOREVER cluster on MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB Cloud) to learn and test your hands-on exercises
    - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/
* What are Databases, Collections, Documents? https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/
    * IMP: Do not learn about Views, Capped Collections and Clustered Collections.
* Basic CRUD operations - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/
    - Important to see syntax, and then the examples...
    - Learn about Query Operators (How to use and when to use) -
        https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/

This is just the basics, the tip of the iceberg (5%) of MongoDB. Just learn it native to MongoDB (run commands via
 MongoDB Shell, directly on MongoDB Atlas or use MongoDB Compass)
